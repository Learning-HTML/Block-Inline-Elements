        Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.
        There are two display values: block and inline.

        A block-level element always starts on a new line.
        A block-level element always takes up the full width available 
        The <div> element is a block-level element.

        An inline element does not start on a new line.
        An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.    
        This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.
     -->
     <div>Hello World</div>

     <span>Hello World</span>
